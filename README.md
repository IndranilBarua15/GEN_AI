# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will **stay with or leave a company** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. The model is trained on a **Customer Churn Dataset** and provides predictions through a user-friendly **Streamlit web application**.

The complete system is divided into **three main parts**:

1. **Model Building & Training**
2. **Prediction System**
3. **Streamlit Representation (UI)**

## 🧠 1. Model Building & Training

In this phase, an ANN model is designed and trained using historical customer data.

### Key Steps:

* Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling)
* Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
* Designing an ANN architecture with input, hidden, and output layers
* Training the model using backpropagation and optimization techniques
* Evaluating model performance using accuracy and loss metrics

The trained model learns complex patterns in customer behavior to identify churn tendencies effectively.

## 🔮 2. Prediction System

After training, the ANN model is used to make predictions on new customer data.

### Prediction Workflow:

* User inputs customer details
* Input data is preprocessed in the same way as training data
* The trained ANN model predicts the outcome
* Output indicates whether the customer is **likely to stay** or **likely to leave** the company

This system enables quick and reliable churn prediction for decision-making.

## 🌐 3. Streamlit Representation

A **Streamlit web application** is built to provide an interactive and simple interface for users.

### Features:

* Input fields for customer attributes
* Real-time prediction on button click
* Clean and interactive UI
* Easy deployment and usability

This interface allows non-technical users to interact with the ANN model effortlessly.
